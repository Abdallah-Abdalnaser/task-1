                <p>
                    We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind.
                    That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before outright replacing it,
                    wherever possible â€“ it requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet,
                    as well as your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

                        We're here to help you with solar panel installation in Devon and Cornwall. If we were to sum ourselves up in a few words, those would be "reliable, honest and friendly." We find our customers agree! We're with you from the start of the project to the finish.

                        As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather than on turning a profit.

The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so we want to help educate people on the big and little things they can do to protect our planet!
